# Task-03: Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
- **Bank Marketing Dataset**
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Dataset used: `bank.csv` (provided via Prodigy InfoTech GitHub repository)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the Bank Marketing dataset
2. Checked for missing values
3. Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Built a Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification report
7. Visualized the decision tree for interpretability

## Results
The Decision Tree model successfully learned patterns from customer data and achieved good prediction accuracy.  
The visualization clearly shows how features such as call duration, age, and previous campaign outcomes influence customer purchase decisions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Decision Tree algorithms can be effectively used for customer behavior prediction and decision-making in marketing analytics.
